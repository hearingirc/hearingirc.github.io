Dear colleagues,

The hearing aid industry’s largest manufacturers have collaborated to create
the Hearing Industry Research Consortium (IRC) to develop and direct a
non-competitive, mutually agreed upon research agenda benefitting the hearing

The IRC is requesting proposals for a research project on “Perception of
dynamic spatial listening scenarios”. The $300,000 grant pool is open to
research labs around the world.  Further details are available on the IRC web

The IRC board is comprised of the heads of research from the top hearing aid
manufacturers in the world including GN ReSound’s Andrew Dittberner; Oticon’s
Graham Naylor; Phonak’s Stefan Launer; Siemens’ Joel Beilin; Starkey Hearing
Technologies’ Brent Edwards; and Widex’ Lars Sunesen.

The deadline for proposals is September 1, 2013, and decisions will be
