Since 2012 the hearing industry’s largest manufacturers have collaborated to
sponsor a non-competitive, mutually agreed upon research agenda benefitting the
hearing aid industry, its customers, and end users. The framework for this
collaboration is the [Hearing Industry Research Consortium (IRC)](http://hearingirc.com).

Coordinated data collection in audiological service delivery systems can be
exploited to examine relations between patient characteristics, treatment
outcomes, and process variables. This may provide new evidence for the
development of improved treatment. Meanwhile, the diversity of real-life
clinical practice may cause any data to be very ‘noisy’, potentially
invalidating conclusions regarding cause and effect. IRC wishes to promote
serious research in this area, and therefore this year the IRC is requesting
proposals within the topic of ‘Large-scale approaches to outcome measurement
and treatment prescription’. The $300,000 funding pool is open to research labs
around the world.

Applications are available on the [Hearing IRC web site](http://hearingirc.com). The
deadline for proposals is August 16, 2015, and decisions will be announced by
December 31, 2015.
