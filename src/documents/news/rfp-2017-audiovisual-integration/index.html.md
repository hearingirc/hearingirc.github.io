Since 2010 the hearing industryâ€™s largest manufacturers have collaborated to
sponsor a non-competitive, mutually agreed upon research agenda benefiting the
hearing aid industry, its customers, and end users. The framework for this
collaboration is the [Hearing Industry Research Consortium (IRC)](http://hearingirc.com/).

This year's [Request for Proposal (RfP)](http://rfp.hearingirc.com) is entitled
"The impact of audiovisual integration on acoustic communication in hearing
impaired adults". Hearing IRC wishes to support pre-competitive research that
advances understanding of the effects of both hearing aid processing and
individual audiovisual integration abilities on hearing aid benefit in real-life
speech communication. For many years, research on the effects of hearing-aid
use has mainly considered factors related to auditory perception. Real-life
communication, however, does not occur solely in the auditory domain, but
instead triggers simultaneous activation of different modalities, requiring
cross-modal integration.

Applications are available on the [Hearing IRC web site](http://hearingirc.com/).
The deadline for proposals is August 18th, 2017, and decisions will be announced
by December 31, 2017.
