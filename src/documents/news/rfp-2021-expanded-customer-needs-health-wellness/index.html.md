The Hearing Industry Research Consortium (IRC) announces its 2021 Request for
Proposals (RFP) for research on "Confirming The Hearing Care Practitioner
(HCP) Role with Respect to Expanded Hearing-Aid-User Needs, Health & Well-Being".

The purpose of this RFP is to stimulate research into the expanding role of the
HCP given rapidly changing technologies. **Today, the HCP needs to understand
social and psychological factors, vestibular anatomy and physiology, cognitive
screening tools, and biometric functions, topics that have not been part of the
traditional scope of practice, and this RFP is designed to confirm and refine
the important role of the HCP.**

The funding pool for this RFP is 300,000 US Dollars, and the time period for
execution of projects under this RFP is 2-3 years from 1st January 2022.
Proposals for projects of two years duration are preferred. It is envisaged
that one or two project proposals will be funded.

Detailed descriptions of the application procedure, the guidelines for research
under this scheme, and the proposed research area can be [downloaded](http://rfp.hearingirc.com)
and also found on the [IRC website](http://hearingirc.com). The deadline for
submission is September 3, 2021.

Questions can be sent to any of the IRC members listed on the website or using
the Contact Form on the website.

The Hearing Industry Research Consortium (IRC) is made up of the heads of
research from the top hearing aid manufacturers in the world, which include GN
Hearing, Oticon, Sonova, WS Audiology and Starkey Hearing Technologies. The IRC
was created to have a non-competitive, mutually agreed upon research agenda
benefiting the hearing aid industry, its customers and end users. For more
