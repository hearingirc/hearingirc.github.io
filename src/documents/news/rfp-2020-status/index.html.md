Dear all,

On behalf of the Hearing Industry Research Consortium (IRC), I would like to
let you know, that we will not post a Request for Proposals in 2020. We a
sorry about this, but reason is that the current conditions, due to the global
COVID-19 situation, has created sub-optimal work conditions for researchers to
generate the proposals. Another reason is that we, as an industry are in a
situation with careful awareness to expenses. I hope that there is an
understanding of this decision. We will return with a new a great topic for
you to consider. So, stay tuned for news in April/May 2021.


Thank you

The Hearing Industry Consortium (IRC)
