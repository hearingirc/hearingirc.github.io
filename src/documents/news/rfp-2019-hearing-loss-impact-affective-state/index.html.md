The Hearing Industry Research Consortium (IRC) announces its 2019 Request for
Proposals (RFP) for research on "The joy of hearing: the impact of hearing loss
and hearing aids on the affective state of the listener".

The purpose of this RFP is to stimulate research into the positive affective
responses to sound stimuli in hearing-impaired individuals. The goal is to
deepen the understanding of the impact of hearing impairment and hearing-loss
compensation on the affective state of the listener. In particular, we are
interested in the involvement of the two reward systems mentioned above in
hearing-impaired individuals, namely, the pleasure of hearing and the
motivational aspects of hearing, and their impact on the quality of life of
hearing-aid users.

The funding pool for this RFP is 300,000 US Dollars, and the time period for
execution of projects under this RFP is 2-3 years from 1st January 2020.
Proposals for projects of two years duration are preferred. It is envisaged
that one or two project proposals will be funded.

Detailed descriptions of the application procedure, the guidelines for research
under this scheme, and the proposed research area can be [downloaded](http://rfp.hearingirc.com)
and also found on the [IRC website](http://hearingirc.com). The deadline for
submission is August 26, 2019.

Questions can be sent to any of the IRC members listed on the website or using
the Contact Form on the website.

The Hearing Industry Research Consortium (IRC) is made up of the heads of
research from the top hearing aid manufacturers in the world, which include GN
Hearing, Oticon, Sonova, WS Audiology and Starkey Hearing Technologies. The IRC
was created to have a non-competitive, mutually agreed upon research agenda
benefiting the hearing aid industry, its customers and end users. For more
