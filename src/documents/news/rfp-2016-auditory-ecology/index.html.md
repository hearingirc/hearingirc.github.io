Since 2010 the hearing industryâ€™s largest manufacturers have collaborated to
sponsor a non-competitive, mutually agreed upon research agenda benefitting the
hearing aid industry, its customers, and end users. The framework for this
collaboration is the [Hearing Industry Research Consortium (IRC)](http://hearingirc.com).

The focus of this RFP is Auditory Ecology, a concept introduced by Gatehouse
(1999) to describe the relationship between the acoustic environments
experienced in everyday life and the perceptual demands of different
individuals in these environments.  Gatehouse found that individuals with more
diverse auditory lifestyles had a stronger preference for more sophisticated
signal processing strategies. Research that seeks to develop tools for
characterizing auditory lifestyles and relates these to the effects of signal
processing would be of benefit to the hearing-aid industry.

Applications are available on the [Hearing IRC web site](http://hearingirc.com). The
deadline for proposals is August 21, 2016, and decisions will be announced by December 31,
2016.
