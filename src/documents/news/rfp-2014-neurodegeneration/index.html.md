During the last five years, our understanding of the pathophysiology of hearing
loss has been substantially enhanced, and challenged, by the discovery of
auditory neuronal damage, which does not always manifest in the audiogram. This
is a very interesting new area of research, and this year the IRC is requesting
proposals within the topic of Neurodegeneration: Perceptual Consequences and
Quantification in Human Subjects. The $300,000 grant is open to research labs
around the world.

Applications are available on the [IRC website](http://www.hearingirc.com). The
deadline for proposals is August 15, 2014, and decisions will be announced by
December 31, 2014.
