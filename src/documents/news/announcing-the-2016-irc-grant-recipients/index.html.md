By the deadline of August 2016 IRC had received a large number of outstanding
grant proposals from leading universities around the world in response to this
year’s request for proposals on auditory ecology and its contribution to quality
of life, with emphasis on the individual.

IRC is very pleased to announce that the 2016 grant recipient is the team lead
by Principal Investigator Dr Inga Holube, Institute of Hearing Technology and
Audiology, Jade University of Applied Sciences in Oldenburg in cooperation with
Dr. Markus Meis from Hörzentrum Oldenburg, Germany.

The project explores the individual hearing aid benefit in real life by
developing tools that momentarily assess the health-related quality of life in
individual every-day listening situations. The concept uniquely combines the
analysis of the acoustical conditions, self-assessments and external
observations that allow characterizing psychologically and sociologically the
behavior of hearing-impaired persons in self-selected environments.

“Once again we are very pleased to have received so many excellent proposals
from universities all around the world. We know it takes a big effort to prepare
such applications, and we want to express our sincere appreciation s to all
applicants for their contribution,” said Stefan Launer, 2016-2017 Chair of the
