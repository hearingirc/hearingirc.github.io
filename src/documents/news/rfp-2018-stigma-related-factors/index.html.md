The Hearing Industry Research Consortium (IRC) announces its 2018 Request for
Proposals (RFP) for research on stigma-related factors influencing the uptake of
hearing aids.

While many people would benefit from hearing instruments, uptake is still low,
especially among those with milder forms of audiometric hearing loss. Among the
factors that hinder uptake of hearing aids, the stigma associated with hearing
aids is an important one. The purpose of this RFP is to stimulate research on
the stigma related to hearing loss and hearing instruments. This research should
deepen understanding of the psychological factors hindering people with hearing
impairment to seek help and especially to develop approaches to help overcome
this hurdle.

The funding pool for this RFP is 300,000 US Dollars, and the time period for
execution of projects under this RFP is 2-3 years from 1st January 2019.
Proposals for projects of two years duration are preferred. It is envisaged that
one or two project proposals will be funded.

Detailed descriptions of the application procedure, the guidelines for research
under this scheme, and the proposed research area can be downloaded
([http://rfp.hearingirc.com](http://rfp.hearingirc.com)) and also found on the
IRC website ([http://hearingirc.com](http://hearingirc.com)). The deadline for
submission is August 18, 2018.

Questions can be sent to any of the IRC members listed on the website or using
the Contact Form on the website.

The Hearing Industry Research Consortium (IRC) is made up of the heads of
research from the top hearing aid manufacturers in the world, which include GN,
Oticon, Phonak, Sivantos, Starkey Hearing Technologies and Widex. The IRC was
created to have a non-competitive, mutually agreed upon research agenda
benefiting the hearing aid industry, its customers and end users. For more
