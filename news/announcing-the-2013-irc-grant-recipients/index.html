most recent RFP. <a href="/news/announcing-the-first-irc-grant-recipients/">Last May</a>,
Piers Dawes, Ph.D., and Andrea Pittman, Ph.D., were
awarded the first IRC grants for research aimed to advance the understanding of
the interaction between cognition and hearing aids.</p>
<p>Goverts is head of the Audiological Center and a medical physicist audiologist
at the VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam, and Colburn is the director
of the Hearing Research Center and professor of biomedical engineering at
Boston University. Their research will take a detailed look at speech
recognition in realistic dynamic listening scenarios.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very excited by the opportunities provided by this grant to address
questions related to spatial hearing in complicated listening situations,” said
Goverts. “We hope that our work will help audiologists to better treat people
with hearing problems.&quot;</p>
<p>Best currently works as a research scientist with the National Acoustic
Laboratories in Sydney, Australia, and as a research assistant professor at
Hearing Research Center, Boston University. Her research will examine a dynamic
speech comprehension task for assessing real-world listening ability and
hearing aid benefit.</p>
<p>“We are delighted that the IRC has decided to support this work. The grant will
enable us to develop a new test that measures how well people can follow
dynamic conversations in noisy places,” said Best. “Using this test we will
also gather new knowledge about how hearing loss and hearing aids affect this
critical part of everyday communication.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are very pleased to have received quite a large number of excellent
proposals from renowned universities all around the world, and we want to thank
every applicant for his or her contribution,” said Stefan Launer, 2013 Chair of
the IRC. “It shows us that we have selected a topic of great interest and
potential for the research community and thus our entire industry. We have
selected proposals that present a mixture between innovative approaches to
basic science and direct clinical applicability. We wish the two selected
research teams great success with their projects, and we very much look forward
to seeing the results being openly and publicly presented and discussed.
Hopefully this initiative will stimulate further research in this exciting
field.&quot;</p>
