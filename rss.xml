            <title><![CDATA[Announcing the 2019 RFP: "The joy of hearing: the impact of hearing loss and hearing aids on the affective state of the listener"]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The Hearing Industry Research Consortium (IRC) announces its 2019 Request for
Proposals (RFP) for research on &quot;The joy of hearing: the impact of hearing loss
and hearing aids on the affective state of the listener&quot;.</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFP is to stimulate research into the positive affective
responses to sound stimuli in hearing-impaired individuals. The goal is to
deepen the understanding of the impact of hearing impairment and hearing-loss
compensation on the affective state of the listener. In particular, we are
interested in the involvement of the two reward systems mentioned above in
hearing-impaired individuals, namely, the pleasure of hearing and the
motivational aspects of hearing, and their impact on the quality of life of
hearing-aid users.</p>
<p>The funding pool for this RFP is 300,000 US Dollars, and the time period for
execution of projects under this RFP is 2-3 years from 1st January 2020.
Proposals for projects of two years duration are preferred. It is envisaged
that one or two project proposals will be funded.</p>
<p>Detailed descriptions of the application procedure, the guidelines for research
under this scheme, and the proposed research area can be <a href="http://rfp.hearingirc.com">downloaded</a>
and also found on the <a href="http://hearingirc.com">IRC website</a>. The deadline for
submission is August 26, 2019.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Announcing the 2018 Grant Recipients]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>In response to the RFP 2018, Stigma-related factors influencing the uptake of
hearing aids, the IRC received eight great project proposal. This is a
relatively small number compared to previous calls, but this may simply reflect
that the topic has had too little attention previously. It is one of the goals
of IRC to identify these under-studied domains in the field of Audiology, and
this seems to be one of them.</p>
<p>We, the IRC, are pleased to announce that the grant winner of the 2018 call is
Professor Louise Hickson and her team at the University of Queensland,
Australia. They excellently presented to proposal, entitled: ”To tell or not to
tell? The stigma experiences of adults with hearing impairment and their
families”.</p>
<p>The project started on March 1st, 2019. In her words, this research project
will provide a first-of-its-kind understanding of stigma in hearing impairment.
This understanding has the potential to inform adults with hearing impairment,
family members, hearing care professionals, referring practitioners (e.g., GPs,
ENTs, Geriatricians), and hearing device manufacturers about how to counsel
adults with hearing difficulties and their families about the pros and cons of
acknowledging hearing loss in everyday life.</p>
<p>The team is thrilled to have this opportunity to undertake this research
project. We believe it will make a valuable contribution to the field and are
excited to get started with this research in 2019!</p>
<p>A key focus of our team’s research program involves exploring the impact of
hearing loss in adults on their quality of life and how and why they take steps
to get help for their hearing difficulties. We had recently been noticing that
stigma related to hearing loss and hearing aids kept appearing in our data as a
possible barrier to help-seeking (both within interviews with people with
hearing impairment and their families, and within our video-recorded audiology
appointment interactions). These observations highlighted to us the
significance of stigma in the everyday lives of adults with hearing impairment
and their families. We were, therefore, keen to explore the notion of stigma
further in our future research.</p>

<p>The IRC is once again very pleased to have received excellent proposals from
globally leading researchers We sincerely appreciate the effort put into these
proposals. We are pleased to stimulate the relevant research fields, both with
potential funding, but also in providing topics of interest to the Industry,
that consequently will lead to greater impact of the conducted research</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The Hearing Industry Research Consortium (IRC) announces its 2018 Request for
Proposals (RFP) for research on stigma-related factors influencing the uptake of
hearing aids.</p>
<p>While many people would benefit from hearing instruments, uptake is still low,
especially among those with milder forms of audiometric hearing loss. Among the
factors that hinder uptake of hearing aids, the stigma associated with hearing
aids is an important one. The purpose of this RFP is to stimulate research on
the stigma related to hearing loss and hearing instruments. This research should
deepen understanding of the psychological factors hindering people with hearing
impairment to seek help and especially to develop approaches to help overcome
this hurdle.</p>
<p>The funding pool for this RFP is 300,000 US Dollars, and the time period for
execution of projects under this RFP is 2-3 years from 1st January 2019.

            <title><![CDATA[Announcing the 2017 Grant Recipients]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The IRC received seventeen outstanding proposals from leading universities and
research institutions around the world in response to its 2017 request for
proposals on the impact of audiovisual integration on acoustic communication in
hearing impaired adults. This topic area recognizes the importance of
considering that real-life communication does not occur solely in the auditory
domain, but instead triggers simultaneous activation of different modalities,
requiring cross-modal integration. The IRC is pleased to announce that the grant
recipients are a team lead by Principal Investigator Prof. Hans Colonius, Carl
von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg, Germany and another team lead by Prof. Anu
Sharma, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, USA.</p>
<p>Hans Colonius is a professor in the Department of Psychology and the Cluster of
Excellence “Hearing4all”, Carl von Ossietzky University Oldenburg. He and his
co-workers, Professor Christiane Thiel, Anja Gieseler, Maike Tahden, and Dr.
Stephanie Rosemann will focus on how hearing aid usage in mild-to-moderately
hearing-impaired elderly affects audiovisual integration, speech perception,
cognitive performance and neural connectivity using both psychophysical methods
and fMRI.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very excited about being able to follow up on our previous work and to
finally realize the project that we have been thinking about for the last
years”, said Prof. Colonius, “by investigating the causal relations between
audiovisual integration, hearing aid use and speech performance in a
longitudinal study!”</p>
<p>Anu Sharma is a Professor in the Department of Speech Language Hearing Sciences,
Institute of Cognitive Science, and Center for Neuroscience at the University of
Colorado Boulder. Her work will focus on examining changes in cross-modal
neuroplasticity and auditory visual processing in age-related hearing loss and
whether intervention with amplification restores auditory visual integration and
underlying cortical networks to a normal state.</p>
<p>Prof. Sharma said: “This is a timely and much-needed topic that was requested by
the IRC. We are excited about being able to conduct the study which will allow
us to better understand the neuroplastic changes underlying auditory visual
integration in hearing loss and how they are impacted by amplification”.</p>
<p>The IRC is once again very pleased to have received so many excellent proposals
from leading researchers all around the world. “We know it takes a big effort to
prepare such applications, and we want to express our sincere appreciation to
all applicants for their contribution,” said Sridhar Kalluri, 2017-2018 Chair of
the IRC.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>By the deadline of August 2016 IRC had received a large number of outstanding
grant proposals from leading universities around the world in response to this
year’s request for proposals on auditory ecology and its contribution to quality
of life, with emphasis on the individual.</p>
<p>IRC is very pleased to announce that the 2016 grant recipient is the team lead
by Principal Investigator Dr Inga Holube, Institute of Hearing Technology and
Audiology, Jade University of Applied Sciences in Oldenburg in cooperation with
Dr. Markus Meis from Hörzentrum Oldenburg, Germany.</p>
<p>The project explores the individual hearing aid benefit in real life by
developing tools that momentarily assess the health-related quality of life in
individual every-day listening situations. The concept uniquely combines the
analysis of the acoustical conditions, self-assessments and external
observations that allow characterizing psychologically and sociologically the
behavior of hearing-impaired persons in self-selected environments.</p>
<p>“Once again we are very pleased to have received so many excellent proposals
from universities all around the world. We know it takes a big effort to prepare
such applications, and we want to express our sincere appreciation s to all
applicants for their contribution,” said Stefan Launer, 2016-2017 Chair of the
IRC.</p>

<p>The focus of this RFP is Auditory Ecology, a concept introduced by Gatehouse
(1999) to describe the relationship between the acoustic environments
experienced in everyday life and the perceptual demands of different
individuals in these environments.  Gatehouse found that individuals with more
diverse auditory lifestyles had a stronger preference for more sophisticated
signal processing strategies. Research that seeks to develop tools for
characterizing auditory lifestyles and relates these to the effects of signal
processing would be of benefit to the hearing-aid industry.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>By the deadline of August 2015 IRC had received 6 outstanding grant proposals
from leading universities around the world in response to the most recent RFP,
which focuses on Big Data Outcome Measurement and Treatment.</p>
<p>IRC is very pleased to announce that the 2015 Grant recipients are the teams
lead by Principal Investigators Dr Peter Nordquist, Research Institute
Hörselbron, KTH Stockholm, Sweden as well as the team lead by Dr Harvey Dillon,
National Acoustic Laboratories, Sydney, Australia. Each team received an award
of 150’000 USD to pursue their research.</p>
<p>Both projects look at how coordinated data collection in audiological service
delivery systems can be exploited to examine relations between patient
characteristics, treatment outcomes, and process variables. This may provide
new evidence for the development of improved treatment. Meanwhile, the
diversity of real-life clinical practice may cause any data to be very ‘noisy’,
potentially invalidating conclusions regarding cause and effect.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Announcing the 2014 Grant Recipients]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>By the deadline in August 2014 IRC had received 21 outstanding grant proposals
from leading universities around the world in response to the most recent RFP.
While last year’s grant recipients, Steven Colburn (Boston University, USA) &amp;
Theo Goverts (VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam) and Gitte Keidser &amp;
Virginia Best (National Acoustic Laboratories, Australia) were focussing on
research in the field of Perception of dynamic spatial listening scenarios, the
2014 RFP focuses on Neurodegeneration: Perceptual Consequences and
Quantification in Human Subjects.</p>
<p>IRC is very pleased to announce that the 2014 Grant recipients are Prof. John
Grose, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Dr. Elizabeth Beach,
PhD, National Acoustic Laboratories, Australia.</p>
<p>John Grose is Professor at the department of Otolaryngology - Head &amp; Neck
Surgery, and his work will focus on characterizing auditory neurodegeneration
in humans, combining basic psychoacoustic measurements with
electrophysiological measurements.</p>
<p>“There is increasing evidence that noise exposure can result in permanent
hearing changes even if the ability to detect quiet sounds remains intact”, Dr
John Grose says - “This project looks specifically at whether regular
attendance at loud music venues is associated with a compromised ability to
discern audible sounds over the long term. I am very enthusiastic be working
with the IRC on this project, as we consider this study an important next step
in our understanding of the perceptual consequences of hearing loss and aging”.</p>
<p>The project will be undertaken in the Hearing Research Laboratory at the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which has a distinguished history
of studying human auditory function using both behavioral and
electrophysiological tests.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Beach is a Research Psychologist at NAL, and her work will focus at
addressing outcomes of a potential target group of noise exposed workers, in
combination with basic auditory assessments. Elizabeth says: “It was such a
great topic for the IRC to initiate a request on, and it was a topic that we
had already been thinking about a lot. We&#39;re very much looking forward to the
study and reaching a better understanding of the nature of hidden hearing
loss.&quot;</p>
<p>Both projects look at the so-called ‘hidden hearing loss’ being an implication
of degeneration of neurons in the auditory fibers, due to noise exposure. The
term ‘hidden hearing loss’ refers to the fact that it is not obvious from an
audiogram, that hearing has deteriorated (significantly), but speech
understanding in noise is severely reduced.</p>
<p>“Once again we are very pleased to have received so many excellent proposals
from universities all around the world. We know it takes a big effort to
prepare such applications, and we want to express our thankfulness to all
applicant for their contribution,” said Joel Beilin, 2014-2015 Chair of the
IRC.</p>
